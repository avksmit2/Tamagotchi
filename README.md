## Description

_This app allows the user to generate a Tamagotchi object that will die if they don't feed it, let it rest, and give it attention enough over time._

# SPECS

*_Behavior: It allows the user to click buttons to feed, rest, and play with their Tamagotchi. Example input: click on feed button. Example output: +10 food.

*_Behavior: It allows the user to click a button to "make time pass," lowering the stats of the Tamagotchi. Example input: click on time button. Example output: -5 food, -5 rest, -5 attention.
